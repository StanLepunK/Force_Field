Force Field
--
Force field is project around the different vector field in Processing can be used in 2D world.
I hope in the short time in the 3D world too.

It's possible to compute a Chaos field, Perlin field, a solid fluid field, a gravity field and magnetic field. And for the artist a picture field !
