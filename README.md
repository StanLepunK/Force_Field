## Force

Force is project to explore the different possibility of vector fields and how to use to steer vehicle and warp image.

With Force you have an access to two field types: static and dynamic. 
For the static field you have four pattern: Chaos, Perlin, Equation and Picture field
For the dynamic field your have three pattern is available: Gravity, magnetic and fluid field.

The dynamic type field work with Spot class, this class manage the field transformation.

Force use the vector field to display a steering vehicle and warp image.

The sketch work easily, run and go.
You can manage your sketch by setting the global variable on the top of the main tab, after you can use the GUI and the keyboard to manage the application :
switch between particles, image, video or camera ; display grid, vector, spot, image...
set the refresh color of warping image or particle.
