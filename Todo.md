Find what the problem with MAGNETIC and GRAVITY field when the class Vehicle is used we lost a lot of frameRate.
I imagine first it's the loop when the Spot is checked to swap position, but unfortunatly not.
The problem is from method follow(), but in this method there is nothing to see with MAGNETIC or GRAVITY ???
